GeoShaderNodes_IE is a Blender extension. 
This extension allows users to export blocks of nodes from both Geometry Nodes and Shader Nodes, so they can be reused in other projects.

## How to use the add-on:
After installing the extension, choose the folder where you want the nodes to be saved. By default, this is set to your desktop.

When you've created nodes you want to reuse, select them. Then click the GeoNodes IE button and give your selection a name (to easily find it later).

All saved nodes will be stored in the same .txt file.

After that, you'll be able to import the different node groups whenever you need them.

The shader version is identical.
